    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This baked salmon is a great recipe for beginners. This was my first time making fish and it was a hit. 
        Even my <em>9-year-old</em> daughter who wouldn't ever dream of eating fish had half of my portion!></p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    6 tablespoons of light olive oil
                </li>
                <li>
                    2 cloves of garlic, minced
                </li>
                <li>
                    1 tablespoon of lemon juice
                </li>
                <li>
                    1 tablespoon of fresh parsley, chopped
                </li>
                <li>
                    1 teaspoon dried basil
                </li>
                <li>
                    1 teaspoon ground black pepper
                </li>
                <li>
                    2 (6 ounce) salmon fillets
                </li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Whisk olive oil, garlic, lemon juice, parsley, basil, salt, and pepper together in a medium bowl.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Arrange salmon fillets in a small glass or ceramic baking dish; pour marinade over salmon. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for about 1 hour, turning occasionally.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Transfer salmon fillets onto a large piece of aluminum foil. Spoon marinade on top and fold up the foil to seal. Place sealed foil packs on a baking sheet.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bake in preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 35 to 45 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Serve hot and enjoy!
